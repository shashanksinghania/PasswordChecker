# PasswordChecker

This program checks and reports how many times the password has been compromised using the haveibeenpwned API. It does so in a more secure manner than the website to increase the security of your search, using SHA1 hashing and a k-Anonymity model. So, the final check is processed on your computer rather than through the internet.
